\section{Open Problems}

The following problems need to be addressed.

\subsection{BuildingSolver}

The building material is preprogrammed as brick. The algorithm needs to be fixed so that buildings can be constructed around roads meeting at any angle, and different building materials need to be specified. Ideally, this program should be built into the \textit{Sumo2Corner} script.

\subsection{Raytracer}

This program requires support for scattering from other stationary elements of the environment, such as trees and poles. Additionally, RSU support should also be implemented.
